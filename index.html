        <h1><span>About Me</span></h1>
        <p>
          <br> <br><br> 
          &emsp; <span>Welcome to my website! I am a Junior at UMass Amherst and I have loved computers my entire life. My first experience with computers was on an old Dell that my family had at home. 
          I was introduced to programming through Scratch and that sparked my interest in learning more about how computers work. In middle school, I received my first laptop and began 
          experimenting with different software and programs.</span>
          <br><br> &emsp;<span>In 8th grade, I built my own PC for my birthday and that's when my love for computers truly took off. I began creating my own programs and games and have been continually 
          learning and growing in my knowledge and skills ever since. </span>
        <br><br>
        &emsp;<span2>Once I took my AP Computer Science course in high school, I knew I wanted to pursue a career in software development. 
          The class gave me a deeper understanding of the fundamentals of computer science and solidified my passion for programming.</span2>

          <br><br>
          &emsp; <span2>During my college years, I have continued to expand my knowledge and skills in computer science by learning various programming languages such as C, C++, Java, Javascript, and Assembly. I also 
          gained experience with programming methods, algorithm structures, and theory. Additionally, I have pursued my own personal projects and in the process learning languages like C#, Python, HTML, CSS, 
          React, as well as version control software like Git. I am excited to bring this knowledge and experience to my future career and continue to share my passion for technology and programming through this website.</span2>

          <br><br>
          &emsp; <span2>Additionally, outside of programing, some of my hobbies include weightlifting, creating music, creating digital art (all of the artwork on my webpage was created by me!), and spending time outdoors.</span2>
